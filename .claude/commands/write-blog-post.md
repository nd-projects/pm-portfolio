# Write Technical Blog Post

Create a thought leadership blog post about: $ARGUMENTS

## Blog Post Structure

### Opening Hook

Start with one of these patterns:

- Controversial statement that challenges conventional wisdom
- Specific anecdote from BMW experience
- Surprising statistic about developer productivity
- Question that resonates with technical PMs

### Main Content Requirements

1. **Establish credibility early** - Mention relevant experience within first 2 paragraphs
2. **Use specific examples** - Include 3-5 concrete examples from BMW developer tools work
3. **Include code snippets** - Show actual code/config examples where relevant
4. **Data-driven arguments** - Support claims with metrics and outcomes
5. **Visual breaks** - Use subheadings, bullet points, and code blocks for scannability

### Technical Depth

- Assume reader is a senior PM or engineering leader
- Don't shy away from technical details
- Explain complex concepts with metaphors
- Include actual commands, queries, or code snippets

### SEO Optimization

- Target keyword: [Extract from $ARGUMENTS]
- Meta description: 155 characters max
- Use H2 and H3 headers strategically
- Include internal links to case studies

### Call to Action

End with one of:

- Actionable framework or checklist
- Challenge to conventional thinking
- Question for reader reflection
- Link to detailed case study

### Social Media Versions

Create accompanying:

- LinkedIn post (1300 chars max) with key insight
- Twitter/X thread (5-7 tweets) with main points
- One quotable snippet for sharing

## Tone and Voice

Professional but conversational. Position as "PM who codes" - technically credible but focused on product outcomes. Use "we" when discussing team achievements, "I" for personal insights.
