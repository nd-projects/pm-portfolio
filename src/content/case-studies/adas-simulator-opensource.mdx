# From Internal Tool to Open Source: The ADAS Simulator Ecosystem

_How I led the open-source transition that transformed BMW's internal testing tool into Eclipse OpenPASS, building industry collaboration and establishing new automotive safety standards._

## The Strategic Decision: Why Open Source?

After achieving [85% safety coverage internally](./adas-simulator-product), our simulation platform faced a critical question: **keep the competitive advantage internal, or transform the entire industry?**

As Product Manager, I advocated for open source—not despite our success, but because of it.

### The Strategic Rationale

#### Beyond Cost Savings: Industry Leadership Through Collaboration

Traditional thinking: "We built something great, let's keep it secret"  
**Strategic thinking**: "We built something great, let's set the industry standard"

<CalloutBox type="tip" title="Strategic Insight">
  Autonomous vehicle safety benefits from industry-wide collaboration, not
  competition. By open-sourcing our superior simulation platform, we transformed
  from a competitive advantage to industry leadership.

    virtual std::string getPluginName() const = 0;
    virtual Version getAPIVersion() const = 0;
};

// Enable third-party scenario types
class CustomScenarioPlugin : public OpenPASSPlugin {
    ScenarioResult execute(const ScenarioConfig& config) override {
        // Custom scenario logic
        return processCustomScenario(config);
    }
